# Characterization-of-the-piglet-group-activities-with-structural-vibration
The project introduced the first system-PigSense to use structural vibration to track animals. The system uses physical knowledge of the structural vibration characteristics caused by pig-activity-induced load changes to recognize different behaviors of the sow and piglets.
